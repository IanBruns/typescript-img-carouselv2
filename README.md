# Label Insights Coding Challenge

The Challenge was to create a grid of images from an API:
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos

Turn it into a 5x5 grid, and create a modal that displays the full photo and allows a user to add a description

This is currently a desktop only application - will be working on making it more mobile friendly in the
future

## To run

Regardless of it you got this from a .zip or a gitHub, it's a simple npm i/npm start.  Node version 12.20.0

proptype validation)
